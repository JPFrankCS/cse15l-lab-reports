### Bugs and Commands 

---
Today, lets start by looking at bugs and testing.   
Here is a failure inducing input for a program:
```
assertEquals("hey", 1,5);
```
Despite this, there are still inputs that don't cause a failure such as:
```
assertEquals("hey", 1,5);
```
Now lets look at the result of running these tests:

This failure is called a symptom. Now that we know the symptom and the input that leads to it, lets take a look at the code:  
  Before:
  ```
  code
  ```
  After:
  ```
  code
  ```

Now, lets switch gears and discuss some bash commands. Particularly we'll focus on the find command. There are a wide variety of ways to use the find command and a variety of ways to modify the command in the command line. We'll look at 4 ways to use this command: __, __, __, __.
