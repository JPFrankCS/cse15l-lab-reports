# Debugging Senario

1.The original post from a student with a screenshot showing a symptom and a description of a guess at the bug/some sense of what the failure-inducing input is. (Don't actually make the post! Just write the content that would go in such a post)
2.A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try (To be clear, you are mimicking a TA here.)
3.Another screenshot/terminal output showing what information the student got from trying that, and a clear description of what the bug is.
At the end, all the information needed about the setup including:
-The file & directory structure needed
-The contents of each file before fixing the bug
-The full command line (or lines) you ran to trigger the bug
-A description of what to edit to fix the bug

Lets discuss debugging! Lets examine a hypothetical online interaction between a TA and a student as the student asks for help debugging their program.

### Reflecting
I really enjoyed building the autograder in the last lab. It was really cool to be able to take a deeper dive into how the system could be improved for users. An interesting thing I learned was the `OSTYPE` varaible and how it can be used to determine the user's operating system when writing scripts that are dependant on that operating system. I also appreciated learning about `if` statements in `bash`. I feel like they really opened up the language for me as far as its applications and ways I could imagine using it.
